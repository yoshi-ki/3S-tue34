This is the Logistello source directory which is licensed under the
GPL. I worked on it from 1992 till 1998. As a result, it's not a
pretty sight: a zillion tools for handling different game file
formats, computing statistics, solving logistic and linear regression
systems, book learning, running tournaments etc. Many of them are now
obsolete. Some of the code is hard to read - some comments and
variable names are even in German (Brett=board,Zug=move,Wert=value).
I hardly can tell which file is actually used anymore. The makefiles
can be a starting point for exploring the source code. The current
Logistello version is generated by "make ../oplayl". I have not
included the training data, nor the opening book, nor the evaluation
and Multi-ProbCut tables. Although the program compiles, it cannot be
used to play Othello out of the box. All the software for creating
missing tables is included, however. What's missing is the 17 million
training positions - which are not that hard to generate nowadays.

The purpose of this release is to present the implementation details
of a strong game-playing program. My hope is that it is useful for
designing coming generations of even stronger programs.
